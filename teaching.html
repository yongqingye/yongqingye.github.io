        <p>As a student, I was fortunate to have mentors and teachers who guided me along my journey, instilling in me a passion for teaching and mentoring that I now bring to my own students. Central to my teaching philosophy is the belief in each personâ€™s innate capacity for learning. Just as generative linguistics seeks to understand the mind's language competence, I strive to guide and inspire my students to harness the generative power of human cognition, while learning from their questions and the communicative process we share. I am conscientious in my efforts to adopt best practices, extending empathy and encouragement with the same grace that my mentors generously shared with me.</p>
