         <h3>Perception of Nasalization</h3>
        <p>This project focuses on three sets of experiments with a production component and a perception component consisting
of identification tasks of gated segments. The experiments examine languages with distinct vowel nasalization patterns – Hindi/Bengali, Comtemporary American English and Spanish. Hindi and Bengali have underlying nasal vowels. English anticipatory vowel nasalization is argued to be phonological (governed by
speakers’ language-specific phonological knowledge) whereas Spanish vowel nasalization is purely
phonetic and coarticulatory, resulted from universal physiological constrains in speech production (see Sole 1992 for further discussion). 
Various theories have been proposed to account for the perceptual patterns of nasalization (Kotzor et al. 2022; Ohala and Ohala 1995; Larihi and Marslen-Wilson 1991, Beddor 2009, 2012). 
          The current project aims to understand the observations reported in previous literature with a formal perceptual model. </p>
        
        <h3>Nasalization in Michigan English</h3>
        <p>I examined the degree and duration of vowel nasalization across different age groups in two distinct phonological contexts (pre-oral and pre-nasal) in Michigan English.
This study aims to deepen the understanding of whether and how non-segmental features change. 
The data analyzed in this study comes from recordings collected by MI Diaries, a longitudinal project collecting self-recorded audio diaries from speakers (ages 3+) in the state of Michigan. 
All data was processed with Google's Automatic Speech Recognition, manually checked and corrected for transcription errors, forced-aligned with Montreal Forced Aligner and analyzed using a Praat script designed to extract nasality from acoustic measurements. 
The degree of nasalization was measured with the acoustic value A<sub>1</sub>-p<sub>0</sub> in four target vowels -- THOUGHT, LOT, FACE and GOAT. 
The results show that as birth year increases, the degree of nasalization decreases in all three contexts. Additionally, there is an increase in variability in the degree of vowel nasalization across all four target vowels as birth year increases. 
It suggests that he younger speakers of Michigan English exhibit less nasality, and their production of nasalization has a higher degree of variability than the older speakers, which could be an indication that nasalization in Michigan English is in the process of change. 
This study adds to a growing body of literature that documents articulatory variation and change in Michigan English, which has been undergoing a series of sound changes including what appears to be a new reorganization of its vowel system. </p>
        <h3>Phonological Inference</h3>
        <p> The Perception of nasalization has been argued to be dependent on the listener’s
knowledge of nasalization in the corresponding languages (Beddor and Krakow
1999; Ohala and Ohala 1991, 1992) and is sensitive to coarticulation patterns in the
language (Fowler and Brown 2000; Krakow et al. 1988; Zellou 2017). Questions
remain about the underlying mechanism of the processing of nasal information
in speech perception. This study focuses on a perceptual experiment with
gated segments of nonce words in Mainstream American English (henceforth MAE)
(Schneider et al. 2004). The results of the study show that native listeners do
rely on phonological inference in processing nasality, and lexical knowledge is not
necessary to understand the incremental perception observed in previous research.
This study adds to the discussion on the perception of nasalization, helps us gain
a better understanding of the processing mechanism behind speech perception, and
contributes to a larger line of theoretical inquiry in the role of the lexicon and
modularity in perception.</p>
