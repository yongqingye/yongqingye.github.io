Hello there!  <br />

My name is Yongqing Ye [jo&#331;t&#597;&#688;i≈ã je] (meaning "evergreen foliage"). I am a computational linguist and speech scientist, employing both behavioral and computational methods to explore human phonological knowledge and its intersections with phonetics and performance systems. <br />

I work with both experimental and corpus data. My current research project centered on developing Bayesian models to investigate the temporal dynamics of vowel nasalization perception. Specifically, I have focused on training acoustic models with data from a range of languages with varying nasalization patterns, such as Hindi, Contemporary American English, and Peninsular Spanish and building perceptual models to delve into how how different sources of knowledge, such as acoustic cues, phoneme likelihood, and underspecification, affect listeners' decision-making during vowel nasalization perception. The goal is to create formal and explicit models of both the acoustic/auditory processes involved in perception and the perceptual computations applied to these acoustic models, allowing us to precisely define, articulate, and evaluate the underlying assumptions, decisions, and predictions that shape our phonological and perceptual theories.  <br />

I am currently a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://lilac.msu.edu">Department of Linguistics, Languages and Cultures</a> at Michigan State University. My main advisor is <a href="https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io">Karthik Durvasula</a>. I am also advised by <a href="https://betsysneller.github.io">Betsy Sneller</a>,  <a href="https://wagnersu.msu.domains">Suzanne Wagner</a>,  <a href="https://bongiov8.msu.domains/index.html"> Silvina Bongiovanni</a> and  <a href="https://liny.msu.domains">Yen-Hwei Lin</a>.  <br />

When I am not doing linguistics, I enjoy hiking in nature, rock climbing, and going to Ren Fairs. I also started drumming and doing archery in the past year.
