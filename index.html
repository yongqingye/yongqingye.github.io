Hello there!  <br />

My name is Anthea (Yongqing) Ye [&#712;&#230;n.&#952;i.&#601; (jo&#331;t&#597;&#688;iŋ) je] (meaning "evergreen foliage"). I am a computational linguist and speech scientist, employing both behavioral and computational methods to explore human phonological knowledge and its intersections with phonetics and performance systems. <br />

I work with both experimental and corpus-based data, using evidence from multiple languages to better understand speech perception. My current research develops formal models of subsegmental speech perception, with a particular focus on how listeners process the temporal dynamics of vowel nasalization.
To investigate this, I train acoustic models on data from languages that differ in their nasalization patterns. I then build Bayesian comparative models and hypothesis-testing models of perception to explore the mechanisms underlying the speech is processed. These models allow us to examine how different sources of knowledge, such as acoustic cues, phoneme likelihood, and underspecification, work together to shape listeners’ decisions during perception. <br />

I received my Ph.D. in linguistics from the <a href="https://lilac.msu.edu">Department of Linguistics, Languages and Cultures</a> at Michigan State University. My primarily worked with <a href="https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io">Karthik Durvasula</a>. I was also advised by <a href="https://betsysneller.github.io">Betsy Sneller</a>,  <a href="https://wagnersu.msu.domains">Suzanne Wagner</a>,  <a href="https://bongiov8.msu.domains/index.html"> Silvina Bongiovanni</a> and  <a href="https://liny.msu.domains">Yen-Hwei Lin</a>.  <br />

When I am not doing linguistics, I enjoy hiking, rock climbing, archery and going to music festivals.
