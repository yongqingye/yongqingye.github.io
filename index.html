    <h1>Hello there!</h1>

    <p>My name is Yongqing Ye [jo&#331;t&#597;&#688;i≈ã je]. I am a PhD candidate in Linguistics at Michigan State University. I am primarily interested in phonetics, phonology, speech perception, sociophonetics, and sound change.</p>

    <p>My research is driven by two mutually reinforcing goals:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>Understanding the structures and relationships in speech perception and production.</li>
      <li>Using the observations and insights drawn from the performance system to inform our understanding of phonological representations and sound change.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>My current project focuses on formalizing a perception model to capture the patterns of nasalization in Hindi, Spanish, and English in different phonological contexts and investigating what nasalization can tell us about perception, production, and sound change.</p>

    <p>My current main advisor is <a href="https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io">Karthik Durvasula</a>. You can download my CV <a href="/assets/yongqingyeCV.pdf">here</a>.</p>

    <p>When I am not doing linguistics, I enjoy hiking, journaling, and going to Ren Fairs. I also started drumming and doing archery in the past year.</p>
