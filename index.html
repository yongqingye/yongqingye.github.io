Hello there,

I am a PhD candidate Linguistics at Michigan State University. <br />
I am primarily interested in sociophonetics, speech perception and production and sound change. <br />
My research is driven by two mutually reinforcing goals: 
(1) understanding the structures and relationships in speech perception and production and 
(2) using the observations and insights drawn from the performance system to inform our understanding of phonological representations and sound change. <br />
My current project focuses on building a perception model to capture the patterns of nasalization in Hindi, Spanish and English in different phonological contexts and investigating what nasalization can tell us about perception, production and sound change.  <br />
