Hello there!  <br />

My name is Yongqing Ye [jo&#331;t&#597;&#688;i≈ã je]. I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://lilac.msu.edu">Department of Linguistics, Languages and Cultures</a> at Michigan State University. <br />
My research is driven by two mutually reinforcing goals: 
(1) understanding the structures and relationships in speech perception and production and 
(2) using the observations and insights drawn from the performance system to inform our understanding of phonological representations and sound change. <br />
My current project focuses on formalizing a perception model to capture the patterns of nasalization in Hindi, Spanish and English in different phonological contexts and investigating what nasalization can tell us about perception, production and sound change.  <br />
My current main advisor is <a href="https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io">Karthik Durvasula</a>. I am also advised by <a href="https://betsysneller.github.io">Betsy Sneller</a>,  <a href="https://wagnersu.msu.domains">Suzanne Wagner</a>,  <a href="https://bongiov8.msu.domains/index.html"> Silvina Bongiovanni</a> and  <a href="https://liny.msu.domains">Yen-Hwei Lin</a>. You can download my CV <a href="/assets/yongqingyeCV.pdf"> here</a> . <br />

When I am not doing linguistics, I enjoy hiking, journaling and going to Ren Fairs. I also started drumming and doing archery in the past year.
