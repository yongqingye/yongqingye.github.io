Hello there!  <br />

My name is Yongqing Ye [jo&#331;t&#597;&#688;i≈ã je]. I am a PhD candidate in the <a href="https://lilac.msu.edu">Department of Linguistics, Languages and Cultures</a> at Michigan State University. <br />
My research is driven by two mutually reinforcing goals: 
(1) understanding the structures and relationships in speech perception and production and 
(2) using the observations and insights drawn from the performance system to inform our understanding of phonological representations and sound change. <br />
My current project is centered on developing Bayesian perception models to analyze the time course of vowel nasalization perception across different languages. Specifically, I have focused on training acoustic models with cross-linguistic data and building perceptual models to delve into how various sources of knowledge, such as acoustics, phoneme likelihood, and underspecification, affect listeners' decision-making during vowel nasalization perception. The goal is to formalize different perceptual theories, enabling us to test their underlying assumptions and predictions more rigorously. <br />
My current main advisor is <a href="https://karthikdurvasula.gitlab.io">Karthik Durvasula</a>.

When I am not doing linguistics, I enjoy hiking in nature, journaling and going to Ren Fairs. I also started drumming and doing archery in the past year.
